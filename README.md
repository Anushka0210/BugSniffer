## Introduction
The Bug Tracking System is a web-based application developed to streamline the process of bug reporting, tracking, and resolution in software development projects. It provides a centralized platform for developers, testers, and project managers to collaborate effectively and ensure timely bug fixes.

## Features
The bug tracking system includes the following features:

- User registration and authentication
- Bug reporting with detailed information
- Bug assignment and ownership management
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Commenting and discussion on bug reports
- Email notifications for bug updates
- Dashboard and reporting for project insights
- Admin panel for user and project management

## Technologies Used
The bug tracking system is developed using the following technologies:

- Java 11
- Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Security)
- Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
- JNDI
- Servlets
- JSP 
- Oracle

## Installation
To set up the bug tracking system locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bug-tracking-system.git
   ```

2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

3. Set up a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the `application.properties` file.

4. Run the application using the IDE's built-in tools or by executing the main class.

5. Access the bug tracking system through the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).

## Usage
Once the bug tracking system is set up, follow these steps to use it:

1. Register a new user account or log in with existing credentials.

2. Create a project or join an existing project within the system.

3. Report bugs by providing detailed information such as bug title, description, and steps to reproduce.

4. Assign bugs to specific developers or leave them unassigned for others to claim.

5. Update bug status, add comments, and collaborate with team members to resolve the issues.

6. Use the dashboard and reporting features to track project progress and gain insights.
